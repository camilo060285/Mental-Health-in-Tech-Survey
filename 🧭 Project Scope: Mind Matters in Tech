ðŸ§­ Project Scope: Mind Matters in Tech
ðŸŽ¯ 1. Goals
The goal of this project is to explore and understand the relationship between workplace environments and mental health outcomes in the tech industry. More specifically, this project aims to:

Identify key factors that influence whether a tech worker seeks mental health treatment.

Predict treatment-seeking behavior using machine learning classification models.

Visualize patterns in mental health attitudes across demographics and workplace characteristics.

Provide actionable insights for employers to improve mental health support.

ðŸ’¾ 2. Data
Dataset: Mental Health in Tech Survey (Kaggle)

Source: Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI)

Key features include:

Demographic information: age, gender, country, etc.

Employment characteristics: remote work status, benefits, company size, openness to mental health.

Mental health history: past diagnoses, treatment history, perception of stigma.

Company support data: availability of resources, policies, training.

Assumptions and notes:

The dataset may contain missing, inconsistent, or sensitive entries (especially in gender and text responses).

It is cross-sectional survey data, meaning causal relationships cannot be confirmed, only associations.

ðŸ“Š 3. Analysis
Step 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handle missing values and remove inconsistent entries.

Standardize categorical responses (e.g., normalize gender labels).

Encode categorical variables for modeling (e.g., one-hot encoding).

Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze distributions of age, gender, and mental health treatment.

Investigate treatment rates by workplace factors.

Use visualization tools (Seaborn, Plotly) to explore relationships and trends.

Step 3: Modeling
Build classification models to predict likelihood of seeking treatment:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost

Evaluate using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1 Score

ROC Curve

Step 4: Insights and Recommendations
Identify features with the strongest impact on treatment behavior.

Segment findings by demographics and workplace types.

Provide practical suggestions for tech employers based on model results and trends.
