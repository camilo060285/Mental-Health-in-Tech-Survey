🧪 Problem Statement
In the tech industry, mental health challenges are widespread, yet support systems vary greatly between companies. This project investigates the relationship between workplace support for mental health and an employee’s likelihood of seeking treatment.

Problem:
Does having company-provided mental health support increase the probability that a tech worker will seek mental health treatment?

Approach:
To answer this, we use hypothesis testing to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in treatment-seeking behavior between employees who report receiving mental health support at work and those who do not.

We also apply logistic regression to control for confounding factors such as age, gender, and work setting, providing a more robust understanding of the impact workplace support may have.


🧾 Load, Check, and Inspect Data
We begin by loading the Mental Health in Tech Survey dataset, which includes responses from 1,259 individuals across 27 variables.

✅ Units of Observation
Each row represents one individual respondent from the tech industry, making the unit of observation appropriate for our analysis of individual behaviors and experiences related to mental health.

📦 Key Variables Available
The dataset contains several important variables relevant to our hypothesis, including:

treatment: Whether the individual has sought treatment for mental health (our target variable).

benefits, care_options, wellness_program, seek_help, anonymity, and leave: Indicators of workplace mental health support.


🔧 Transform Your Variables as Needed
To ensure valid comparisons and prepare for modeling, we transformed several variables in the dataset:

📐 Units and Scaling
age_scaled: Normalized the age variable to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.
Useful for algorithms sensitive to scale like logistic regression or KNN.

📅 Date Handling
survey_year: Extracted the year from the timestamp column to allow for any potential time-based grouping or analysis.

🧩 Categorical Encoding
Converted several binary categorical variables into numeric format using Label Encoding:

self_employed_encoded

family_history_encoded

treatment_encoded

remote_work_encoded

tech_company_encoded

🔢 Ordinal Transformation
work_interfere_score: Transformed work_interfere responses into a numerical scale:

Never → 0

Rarely → 1

Sometimes → 2

Often → 3

"Don't know" → -1

These transformations prepare the dataset for valid statistical modeling, clearer visualizations, and comparison across variables.

Absolutely! Here's a well-written section you can directly include in your project under “Set up Your Hypothesis Tests”, tailored specifically to your mental health dataset and research question:

📊 Set up Your Hypothesis Tests
To understand the relationship between workplace mental health support and treatment-seeking behavior, we will conduct a hypothesis test comparing two groups: those who report having mental health benefits at work and those who do not.

🧠 Research Question:
Are tech workers whose companies offer mental health benefits more likely to seek mental health treatment than those without such benefits?

✅ Hypotheses
Null Hypothesis (H₀):
There is no difference in the proportion of treatment-seeking individuals between those who have and do not have mental health benefits at work.

Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):
The proportion of treatment-seeking individuals is higher among those who have access to mental health benefits at work.

This will be a one-tailed (right-tailed) test since we are specifically testing if benefits increase treatment-seeking behavior.

🎯 Confidence Level
Alpha level (α): 0.05
We will reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is less than 0.05, indicating a statistically significant difference.

🧪 Test Preparation
To perform this test, we will:

Filter the dataset to include only valid entries for:

treatment (Yes/No)

benefits (Yes/No)

Count the number of people who sought treatment within each group (benefits vs. no benefits).

Use a two-proportion z-test to compare the proportions of treatment-seekers between the groups.

🧪 Conduct Your Tests
To examine whether access to workplace mental health benefits is associated with a higher likelihood of seeking mental health treatment, we performed a two-proportion z-test comparing the proportion of treatment-seekers between:

Group A: Employees who report that their employer offers mental health benefits

Group B: Employees who report that their employer does not offer mental health benefits

🔍 Test Results
Z-statistic: 4.54

P-value: 2.77 × 10⁻⁶

Alpha level: 0.05

📌 Conclusion
Because the p-value is significantly lower than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.

🧠 This suggests that tech workers with access to mental health benefits are significantly more likely to seek treatment compared to those without such benefits.

🔗 Choose Causal Analysis Method
To explore causality—whether mental health benefits cause an increase in treatment-seeking behavior—we need more than just correlation or association.

Since this dataset is observational and not from a randomized experiment, we must choose a method that can help us control for confounding variables and simulate causal inference.

✅ Chosen Method: Logistic Regression with Controls
We use logistic regression to estimate the probability of seeking treatment based on whether an employee receives mental health benefits, while controlling for confounding variables, such as:

Age

Gender

Remote work status

Family mental health history

Work interference (ordinal)

Company size

⚠️ Assumptions & Considerations
Independence of observations:
Each response comes from a unique individual → ✅

Binary outcome variable:
treatment is Yes/No → ✅

Linearity of log odds:
We'll treat continuous and ordinal predictors carefully (e.g., use work_interfere_score) → ✅ with caution

Multicollinearity:
Should be checked in model diagnostics → 🔍 To do

🧩 Confounding Variables
There are possible confounders we’ve considered and will include in the model:

Mental health history in the family

Interference of mental health with work

Gender and age (which may affect access and attitudes)

These controls help us isolate the effect of workplace benefits on treatment-seeking behavior.

🔍 Run Causal Model
To explore the causal relationship between mental health benefits and the likelihood of seeking treatment, we ran a logistic regression model using the following predictors:

benefits_binary (main causal variable)

age_scaled

family_history_encoded

remote_work_encoded

work_interfere_score

The outcome variable was treatment_encoded, which equals 1 if the respondent reported seeking treatment and 0 otherwise.

🧪 Key Results
Predictor	Odds Ratio (OR)	95% CI	p-value
Benefits (Yes)	2.33	[1.56, 3.48]	< 0.001
Age (scaled)	1.24	[1.02, 1.50]	0.027
Family history (Yes)	2.55	[1.72, 3.77]	< 0.001
Remote work	1.09	[0.71, 1.67]	0.699
Work interferes (↑)	3.92	[3.25, 4.73]	< 0.001

📌 Interpretation
Respondents with access to mental health benefits are 2.33× more likely to seek treatment, holding other factors constant.

Work interference is a very strong predictor — the more mental health interferes with work, the more likely someone is to seek treatment.

Family history also significantly increases the likelihood.

Remote work does not appear to have a significant effect in this model.

⚠️ Limitations & Validity
This is an observational dataset, so causality is inferred, not proven.

We controlled for several confounders, but unmeasured variables (e.g., personal stigma, access to care) may still influence results.

Multicollinearity appears low, but formal VIF tests could strengthen the assumption check.


📢 Communicate Findings
This project explored how workplace mental health support affects the likelihood of seeking treatment among tech workers, using real survey data.

💡 Key Insights
🧠 Employees with access to mental health benefits are 2.3× more likely to seek treatment than those without.

⚙️ Work interference is the strongest driver: as mental health problems affect work more, treatment-seeking rises significantly.

🧬 Family history also increases treatment likelihood — highlighting the personal context of mental health decisions.

💻 Surprisingly, remote work status had no significant impact on treatment behavior in this dataset.

📊 Visual Highlights
A bar chart shows that treatment-seeking is higher in companies offering benefits.

A stacked plot reveals that employees who report mental health interferes with work are much more likely to have sought help.

A logistic regression model confirms these relationships even after controlling for confounders like age and family history.

🧾 Full visualizations and model results are available in the EDA and modeling notebooks.

👥 Recommendations for Managers & HR
Offer visible, formal mental health benefits. Employees are far more likely to seek care when they know support exists.

Foster open conversation around how mental health affects work — stigma may block early intervention.

Don’t assume remote work replaces support. Benefits still matter, even in flexible environments.

📣 Next Steps
Share findings in a blog post or internal dashboard for awareness.

Explore causal models with more workplace culture metrics in future surveys.

Consider employee interviews to give qualitative depth to the trends observed.


✅ Conclusion
Through this project, we explored how workplace mental health support impacts treatment-seeking behavior among tech professionals. Using a combination of exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and logistic regression modeling, we uncovered meaningful insights that contribute to understanding mental health in the tech industry.

🔍 What We Learned
We learned how to clean and wrangle messy survey data, identify relevant variables, and apply appropriate statistical methods for both association and causal inference.

We practiced hypothesis testing with a two-proportion z-test and built a causal model using logistic regression to control for potential confounders.

We saw how data storytelling and visualization play a key role in making findings clear and actionable to stakeholders.

🎯 Were the Results Expected?
Some findings confirmed our expectations — notably that employees with access to mental health benefits are significantly more likely to seek treatment.

However, it was surprising that:

Remote work status showed no significant influence on treatment-seeking.

Work interference turned out to be a very strong predictor of whether someone sought help — stronger than some demographic features.

🧠 Key Takeaways
Access to formal mental health support at work matters — employees are over 2× more likely to get help when it’s provided.

Mental health interfering with work is a major driver of action, signaling a potential trigger point for intervention.

Data science can support policy recommendations by identifying patterns and communicating them clearly to decision-makers.

This project shows how data science can be used not just for prediction, but for promoting well-being and informing change. Mental health deserves visibility — and data can help bring it to light.


🔄 Next Steps
Being a data scientist means always seeking ways to improve and build upon your work. While this project revealed valuable insights into mental health and workplace support in tech, there are several ways it could be expanded, refined, or extended in the future.

🔧 What Could Be Done Differently?
More robust handling of categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding for non-binary responses) could improve model accuracy.

Gender normalization and inclusion could be improved to reflect diverse identities beyond the binary.

Missing values in key fields like work_interfere and self_employed were filled with generic labels — more sophisticated imputation might produce better estimates.

🔍 Deeper Analyses to Explore
Interaction effects: How does the impact of mental health benefits differ across genders, countries, or job types?

Sentiment analysis on the comments field (if more data were available) could uncover qualitative insights.

Time trends: If survey data across multiple years becomes available, longitudinal analysis could reveal whether mental health support is improving over time.

📦 Potential New Data Sources
Include company-level variables like industry, work culture, or HR policies.

Merge with public datasets on mental health access by country to understand structural influences.

Collect more granular data on treatment types, outcomes, or costs if available.

🚀 How This Can Be Used in the Future
Tech companies and HR departments can use these insights to inform workplace policy.

Researchers can extend the causal modeling with experimental or quasi-experimental designs.

Advocacy groups can use the visual findings to communicate the real impact of workplace support on mental health behavior.

By iterating on this analysis and continuing to ask thoughtful questions, we can move closer to creating healthier, more inclusive tech environments where support is not just available — but visible, accessible, and actionable.

Age, Gender, Country, remote_work, no_employees: Demographic and employment context.

work_interfere: How mental health interferes with work.

These variables give us the necessary granularity to explore both individual and workplace factors.

🔍 Initial Observations
The dataset has 1,259 rows and 27 columns.

Some columns have missing values, notably:

state: 515 missing

work_interfere: 264 missing

self_employed: 18 missing

comments: 1,095 missing — this is a free-text field, not used for quantitative analysis

🧪 Next Steps
Clean and standardize key variables (e.g., Gender, Age)

Handle missing values, especially in work_interfere and self_employed

Begin exploratory data analysis to uncover trends and patterns


🧹 Data Wrangling and Tidying
To prepare the dataset for analysis, we performed the following cleaning steps:

📐 Shape of the Data
Before cleaning: 1,259 rows × 27 columns

After cleaning: 1,251 rows × 25 columns
(Removed unrealistic ages and columns with excessive missing values)

🛠 Data Cleaning Steps
Standardized column names to lowercase with underscores for consistency.

Converted the timestamp column to datetime format.

Filtered invalid age entries by keeping respondents aged between 17 and 99.

Dropped high-missing-value columns like comments and state.

Filled missing values:

work_interfere → filled with "Don't know"

self_employed → filled with "Not specified"

🧾 Data Types (Post-Cleaning)
All variables now have appropriate types for analysis, including categorical (object) and numerical (int, datetime) formats.


🔍 Explore the Data
Once cleaned, we explored the dataset through summary statistics and visualizations to understand patterns and relationships related to mental health in the tech industry.

📊 Descriptive Statistics
Age was the primary numerical variable:

Mean: 32.1 years

Median: 31 years

Range: 18 – 72 years

Standard Deviation: 7.29 years

The age distribution is centered in the late 20s to mid-30s, which reflects the young adult demographic common in tech.

🧠 There were no strong correlations among numerical features, as age was the only quantitative field.

📈 Univariate Visualizations
Age Distribution: Most respondents are between 25 and 40 years old.

Treatment Count: A significant number of tech workers reported having sought treatment for mental health issues.

📊 Multivariate Visualizations
Mental Health Benefits vs. Treatment:
Respondents whose companies offered mental health benefits were more likely to have sought treatment.

Work Interference vs. Treatment:
As mental health interference at work increased ("Often" or "Sometimes"), the likelihood of seeking treatment also increased.



🔍 These early insights suggest that both company-provided support and perceived work interference are strong indicators of treatment behavior — supporting our project hypothesis.
