# Mental-Health-in-Tech-Survey
Debugging Minds: A Data-Driven Look at Mental Health in Tech

# 🧠 Mind Matters in Tech

## 📍 Overview

Mental health is increasingly recognized as a critical issue in the tech industry, where high-pressure environments and intense workloads are common. This data science project explores survey data from tech professionals to uncover insights about mental health in the workplace. 

Using data collected by [OSMI (Open Sourcing Mental Illness)](https://osmihelp.org/), the goal is to analyze patterns, build predictive models, and raise awareness about how personal and organizational factors impact mental health outcomes.

## 📦 Dataset

**Source:** [Kaggle - Mental Health in Tech Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey)

The dataset contains responses from over 1,400 tech workers and includes:
- Demographics (age, gender, country)
- Employment details (remote work, benefits, openness)
- Mental health history
- Employer support and workplace culture

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🔍 Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends
- 🧪 Build classification models to predict if a person is likely to seek mental health treatment
- 📊 Visualize relationships between workplace culture and mental health
- 🧠 Identify gaps and opportunities for improving support in tech environments

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly**
- **Scikit-learn** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Kaggle** (for dataset and initial exploration)

## 🧪 Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values
   - Standardize gender entries
   - Encode categorical variables

2. **EDA**
   - Age distribution, gender participation
   - Treatment-seeking patterns
   - Company support vs. mental health outcomes

3. **Modeling**
   - Classification to predict treatment-seeking behavior
   - Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

4. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Which features most influence mental health decisions?
   - How do company attitudes affect employee outcomes?

---

## 📈 Sample Visualizations

- Heatmaps showing correlation between variables
- Bar charts of treatment rates by country and gender
- Decision tree or feature importance from models

---

## 💡 Key Insights (To Be Filled)

- e.g. "People in companies with formal mental health policies are 40% more likely to seek help."
- e.g. "Remote workers report better support perceptions than on-site employees."
